The Real 90s Button
===================

I'm fully in love with 90's music. It's the music from my early childhood. One of my first CD was from DJ Bobo - don't worry, I'm over it now. But in some weak moments I open the website The 90's button, which contains hundreds of music videos of that age. Some months ago we planned a 90's party to get that feeling back and wanted to use that website for the music on a big beamer. There was only one thing that we was missing: A real physical button! So I build one on my own. If you want to have that button too I will show you how. It may not win the price for it's beauty but it will work. It's easy and a very basic level.
